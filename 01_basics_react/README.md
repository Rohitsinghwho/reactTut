# React js Tut files<br>

In this repo i am pushing those files of react js which are made using [Vite]
(https://vitejs.dev/) as a build tool.<br><br>
**Note:** I have used the Vite version 2.7.10 for making
these tutorials.</s>

##  Setup Environment
- Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows).
- Type `node --version` to check if Node.js is installed, it should return a
version number. If not installed, download and install from
[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/).
- Open browser and search Vite then copy the command for installing vite on your project that is npm i vite@latest
- Configure the vite environmet
- install nodemodules using npm install
- you will find all the tuts happy hacking!
